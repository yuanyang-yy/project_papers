# Project Plan


**Author**: Team 044: Jeff Clem, Samantha Ho, Hannah Morilak, Yuan Yang

## 1 Introduction

The product is a single-user Android mobile application that allows the user to view and compare jobs based on optionally weighted metrics such as salary and shares of stock. 

## 2 Process Description
**This part is created specifically based on the development of JobCompare app.**

#### Activity 1: Planning and Design
* Description: During this activity, the requirements and use cases are analyzed and addressed. Furthermore, the development process is detailed planned and the design of the app is established.
* Entrance Criteria: fully understanding of the requirements provided.
* Exit Criteria: 
  * Produce complete use-case model that align with the requirements provided.
  * Produce stable software architecture design (e.g., component and deployment diagrams) and low-level design diagrams (e.g., class diagram) based on the use cases and developing environment. Structures and behaviours demonstrated in design diagrams should fully fulfill the requirements. 
  * Produce project development plan with milestones and timeline, and test plan with possible test cases. Project plan should guarantee on-time project completion, while test plan should provide test plan, test cases and testing technologies for every scenario and feature. 
  * Produce test plan with possible test cases. Test plan should provide test cases and testing technologies for every scenario and functionality of the app.
  * Produce clear user interface design mockups that provide the specific layout of the user interface of the system (layout of input fields and buttons needed).

#### Activity 2: Implementation
* Description: During this activity, based on the design outcomes from Activity 1, all the product features are implemented. Meanwhile, the design could be revised.
* Entrance Criteria: completion of Activity 1.
* Exit Criteria: 
  * Revise the design and project plan based on the better understanding of the product.
  * Produce the initial app integrated on appropriate Android Platform (minimum API level for the app should be “API 29: Android 10.0 (Q)”)
    * All the use cases are realized.
    * Product should be stable on the platform.
    * App state should persist between runs by leveraging SQLite.

#### Activity 3: Testing
* Description: During this activity, all the features of the product are tested and is ready to be deployed to user. The test plan could be further revised.
* Entrance Criteria: completion of Activity 2.
* Exit Criteria:
    * Revise test plans and test cases based on the better understanding of the product.
    * Produce initial test results based on the test plan.
    * Product is mature and ready to be deployed.

#### Activity 4: Deployment and Maintenance
* Description: During this activity, the app is deployed and fully tested on AVD. At this point, any encountered bugs are fixed and new features could be added if necessary.
* Entrance Criteria: completion of Activity 3.
* Exit Criteria:
  * Produce complete set of artifacts (e.g., implementation code, final designs, final test results based on the test plan).
  * An APK file for app need to be added, including all the code and assets.
  * App should be in-use.
  * Any issue discovered after deployment is fixed, and any new feature requested is implemented and tested.
