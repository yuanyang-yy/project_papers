        "Memory networks learn to access external memory stores (a database or, in the case of this assignment, a dictionary). Key-Value Memory Networks specifically assume that the external memory store is organized as a dictionary with keys and values. In theory memory networks are useful when one wants a neural network to be able to know a lot of information but we don't want to try to encode that information directly into the parameters of the network. This means information can be changed in the external memory database without retraining the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a question, e.g., \"Where was Alexander Hamilton born?\", a key-value memory network learns an embedding such that the question has a high cosine similarity to a particular key in the external dictionary. Because there are many keys that need to be matched against, key-value memory networks implement an attention-scoring mechanism to select a key. Because attention is a probabilistic score, the key-value memory network retrieves a sum of embeddings weighted according to the attention score. This weighted embedding is then compared to values using a second attention-scoring mechanism. The value with the highest cosine similarity can then be retrieved and returned as the answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory networks were an important part of the evolution of question-answering systems that have been eclipsed by transformers. However, the attention mechanism in a key-value memory network is very similar to the self-attention inside a transformer, so implementing a key-value memory network is a really great way to experiment self-attention without the added complexity of transformers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key-value memory networks are also closely related to retieval-based generation networks.\n",

        "The KVMemNet will take in a third input, a stack of values associated with the stack of keys. This will also be of shape `num_values x vocab_size`. Each row is embedded using the same embedding, $v=A(values)$, producing a tensor of shape `num_keys x embed_dim`.\n",

        "The attention scores `p` are computed by taking the inner-product (`torch.inner()`) between `q` and `k`. The result will be a 1D tensor with `num_keys` length. Use softmax so that `p` contains scores between 1.0 and 0.0.\n",

Instead there should be a selection mechanism that selects just a subset of the database. This subset should contain the best key for the question $x$ to match against, and its corresponding value. We assume that a shallow selection process can narrow down the key-value pairs to a relatively small set, one of which will be best. For example, if the question involves \"Alexander Hamilton\", we can reasonably guess that the best key-value pair is in the part of the database associated with the named person.\n",

This is a bit unusual, but necessary to figure out the correct target (the true index of the best value to match against) for training.\n",

This would be used in the case where the answer cannot be inferred directly from the question in a single retrieval, such as \"What was the founding date of the country that Alexander Hamilton was born in?\". To implement multi-hop retrieval, the KVMemNet will have additional linear layers $R_1...R_n$. Each $R_{i}$ will do a linear transform on `q` then attention will score and retrieve values as feature weights `o`. This will be sent to the next $R_{i+1}$ and so on until the hops are complete. This final `o` will be returned.\n",

To do this, functions like `.inner()`, `.mm()`, and`.matmul()` will not work. Instead use `.bmm()` which handles batching correctly. You will probably need to do some `.squeeze()` and `.unsqueeze()` operations to make sure your tensors are the correct shapes.\n",

Another modification associated with the vocabulary is that not only for the reduced vocabulary, but I also added the word \"unk\" to the original vocabulary to improve the generalization of the model when dealing with any data that does not exist in the current Database (DB). Therefore, the model could also be used to solve some random questions online as long as we have info (key-value pairs) associated with a person appearing in a question.\n",

During training on real data, I compared training on data with four different vocabularies: \n",

        "> For the rare words removal, I removed words that appeared only once in the entire database (DB). I chose to remove words that appeared only once to avoid removing important information: the names of people in the datasets are crucial for the training part, and some rare names could appear only twice in the DB (once associated with the key \"name\" in the DB's info part of each person, and once associated with the key of the DB dictionary). After this step, the vocabulary size could be reduced from 96,094 to 57,103. The training time on 500 datasets was improved by more than two times, but it still took more than 2 hours on a regular CPU. \n",
        ">\n",
        "> Moreover, since I only used 600 datasets in total during model training and testing, I reduced the vocabulary by including only the words that appear in the first 600 datasets in the DB and replacing all other words with unknown words. Adding this step to the reduction of rare words further reduced the vocabulary size from 57,103 to 3,208. The training time for 500 datasets for 30 epochs was reduced to a couple of minutes on a regular CPU. \n",

        "> When comparing vocabulary with a size of 3,208 to the ones with 96,094 and 57,103, the training losses and accuracies across epochs showed no significant difference. Therefore, in this project, I chose to use the vocabulary with rare words removed and containing only the words from the first 600 datasets. The mechanism of the model training is not to remember all the data, but to learn how to locate data when given a question. When using the trained model, even if some words in the given question are unknown to the vocabulary, the trained model should still be able to provide the correct answer or value for the input question (this was validated in Part E against \"Alexander Hamilton\" data since this person does not exist in the first 600 datasets)."

        "The hyperparameters were tuned to achieve better performance of the model. After tuning, the learning rate was set to 2e-3, the embedding size was set to 100, and the number of epochs was set to 30. The chosen learning rate is not very small because it needs to be large enough to avoid the model getting stuck at a local sub-optimal minimum. The embedding size was tuned to be 100 because this value balanced impact on training time and performance. A larger embedding size could result in a longer training time, while a smaller embedding size could reduce the amount of information that the model can learn. The number of epochs is set to a large number of 30 because I want to monitor whether the model is experiencing any underfitting or overfitting during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture of the model was implemented according to the flowchart in the picture listed in Part B. The vocabulary size is the size of the reduced vocabulary I picked in the answer to Q1 (size 3,208). The optimizer used for the model is the AdamW algorithm, while the loss function is cross-entropy.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the training loop implementation, in each epoch, 500 datasets for training were iterated. For each person in the training datasets, all their associated info is extracted from the preprocessed training data. In addition to the current person, data from two other random people were also extracted. This step could augment the training data and make it more complicated, further preventing the model from memorizing data and causing overfitting. In this case, the model could lean more towards learning the relations for generalization capability. Moreover, I made sure the two random people picked were different from the current person (3 distinct people) to avoid having all data belong to the same person (if this is the case, then picking two random datasets would make no difference).\n",
        "\n",
        "Data from three people are further concatenated to serve as one whole dataset, and all the keys (name + key) and values (name + value) are extracted from it. The next step is to iterate through all the questions/keys in this dataset. For each question, use the current question, all the keys, and all the values as input to the model to get the predicted answer. Most of the remaining procedures follow the presented workflow in the picture in Part C. The only difference is that the `softmax()` operation after the inner product of the predicted answer and embedded values was removed. This is because Torch's cross-entropy loss function contains a `LogSoftMax` layer, and it only takes unnormalized data as input. After removing this `softmax()` operation after the inner product, it was observed that the training time was decreased by around 2 minutes and the performance also improved (mean loss at epoch 29 was reduced from ~2.86 to ~0.18). Unlike synthetic data, the accuracy was not found to be improved much. This could be due to the size of the model for real data being much larger than for synthetic data, and the model for real data is more persistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model backpropagation was also included: compute the loss between the target and predicted output, backpropagate, and update weight parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, each epoch's mean loss and accuracy were also recorded. The output prediction used for each epoch is the argmax() of the predicted output from the model, and accuracy was computed by counting the number of correct predictions (compared to the target: the index of the current question, its actual answer should have the same index)."
